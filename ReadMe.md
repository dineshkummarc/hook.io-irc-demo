# hook.io-irc - IRC Client hook for hook.io

## Unreleased
<!---
hook.io-irc is a client wrapper around [node-irc](http://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc) that provides both support for hook.io events (emitting them on IRC events and providing a hook.io API for IRC interaction) and a basic command-line interface for direct IRC interaction.  

hook.io-irc is v0.0.1; the hook.io API is unstable, and the CLI interface is barebones.
The version is frozen pending official release - fixes will be continuous until then.  


To install:

     git clone git@github.com:AvianFlu/hook.io-irc.git

Usage:

     cd hook.io-irc
     npm install
     bin/irc [-s or --shell for command-line client]

More coming soon!
